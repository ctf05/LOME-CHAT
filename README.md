# LOME-CHAT

**One interface. Every AI model. Your data stays yours.**

LOME-CHAT is a unified AI chat interface that lets you access GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and dozens of other models from a single application. Switch models mid-conversation. Keep your history forever. Never manage another AI subscription.

## The Problem

Every few months, a new "best AI model" launches. The cycle is exhausting:

```
1. New model releases, everyone says it's the best
         ↓
2. Sign up for new service, enter payment info
         ↓
3. Learn new interface, find the features
         ↓
4. Conversations stuck in old platform
         ↓
5. Managing multiple subscriptions
         ↓
6. Another new model releases...
         ↓
   (repeat forever)
```

Your AI history is fragmented across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity, and whatever launched last week. Each has different features, different interfaces, different billing. You're locked into ecosystems that don't talk to each other.

## The Solution

LOME-CHAT ends the cycle. One interface, every model, forever.

When a new model launches, you don't migrate—you just select it from the dropdown. Your conversations, your projects, your workflow stay exactly where they are. The AI industry moves fast. Your tools shouldn't force you to move with it.

## Our Principles

### Privacy First

We believe your conversations with AI are deeply personal. They contain your ideas, your questions, your work. We will never sell your data. We will never train on your conversations. We will never monetize your privacy.

**Local-Only Mode:** For maximum privacy, create conversations that never touch our servers. Your messages go directly to the AI provider and are stored only in your browser. We can't see them. We can't store them. They're yours alone.

### Radical Transparency

We charge a **5% fee** on AI model usage. That's it. No hidden fees. No premium tiers that unlock basic features. No "free" tier subsidized by selling your data.

You pay for what you use. We take a small cut to keep the lights on. The math is simple and public.

### No Data Monetization

We will never:
- Sell your conversations to third parties
- Use your data for advertising
- Train AI models on your chats
- Share your information with data brokers

This isn't a marketing promise—it's our business model. We make money from the 5% fee. We have no incentive to monetize your data because we've built a sustainable business without it.
