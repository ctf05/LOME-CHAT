# Contributor License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to LOME-CHAT, a project of LOME-AI LLC ("Company", "we", "us").

This Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement") clarifies the terms under which you ("Contributor", "you") may contribute code, documentation, or other materials ("Contributions") to our project.

## Why We Have a CLA

This CLA is standard practice for projects that need clear ownership of their codebase. It allows us to:

- Maintain the project under consistent legal terms
- Protect contributors and the project from legal disputes
- Make decisions about licensing without tracking down every contributor

## Agreement

By submitting a Contribution to this repository, you agree to the following terms:

### 1. Definitions

A "Contribution" is any original work, including code, documentation, designs, or other materials, that you submit to this project through pull requests, issues, comments, or any other means.

### 2. Grant of Rights

You grant to LOME-AI LLC a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, sublicense, and distribute your Contributions as part of this project or any other LOME-AI LLC project.

You also assign to LOME-AI LLC all right, title, and interest in and to your Contributions, including all intellectual property rights. Where such assignment is not permitted by applicable law, you grant us an exclusive, unlimited license as described above.

### 3. Your Representations

By submitting a Contribution, you represent that:

- You are the original author of the Contribution
- You have the legal right to grant the rights in this Agreement
- Your Contribution does not violate any third party's rights
- If your Contribution was created as part of your employment, you have obtained necessary permissions from your employer
- You understand your Contribution becomes part of a proprietary project

### 4. No Compensation

You understand that your Contributions are voluntary. You will not receive payment or compensation for your Contributions unless separately agreed in writing.

### 5. No Obligation

We are not obligated to use, include, or maintain your Contributions. We may modify or remove Contributions at our discretion.

### 6. Ongoing Contributions

This Agreement applies to all Contributions you submit, now and in the future, unless you notify us in writing that you no longer agree to these terms (which will not affect Contributions already submitted).

## How to Sign

When you open your first pull request, a GitHub bot will comment asking you to agree to this CLA. Simply reply with a comment stating:

> I have read the CLA and I agree to its terms.

Your agreement will be recorded automatically. You only need to do this once.
