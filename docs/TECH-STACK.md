# Tech Stack

## Overview

This document defines the complete technology stack for the AI chat aggregator application. All choices optimize for: serverless architecture, local development parity, end-to-end type safety, minimal vendor lock-in, and cost efficiency.

---

## Core Values

**Serverless Architecture**
Pay for what you use. Zero idle costs.

**Local Development Parity**
Every production service runs locally. Developers never need production access. What works on your machine works in production.

**End-to-End Type Safety**
TypeScript everywhere. Shared schemas between frontend and backend. Change a type, get errors everywhere it breaks—before users do.

**Universal Idempotency**
Every operation is safe to retry. Network glitch? Just retry. No duplicate charges, no corrupted state.

**Frequent Forever Backups**
Your data is backed up daily to geographically separate storage. Encrypted. Verified.

**Cost Efficiency**
Optimize for low costs.

**Developer Experience First**
One command starts everything. Clear errors. Fast iteration. If it's painful to develop, it's painful to maintain.

**Minimal Vendor Lock-in**
Standard tools, standard protocols.

**Accessibility Compliance**
Every feature works for everyone. WCAG compliance.

**No Security Through Obscurity**
Our security doesn't depend on hiding how things work. The source code is visible. Our architecture is documented. Security comes from good design, not secrets.

## Language

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **TypeScript** | All code (frontend, backend, shared packages). Enables type safety across the entire stack with shared schemas. |

---

## Frontend

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **React 19** | UI framework. Largest ecosystem, best Capacitor support, excellent for text-heavy interfaces. |
| **Vite** | Build tool and dev server. Fast HMR, simple config, no SSR complexity for SPA. |
| **TanStack Router** | Routing. Fully type-safe routes, params, and search params. Compile-time errors for invalid routes. |
| **TanStack Query** | Server state management. Caching, background refetching, request deduplication for all API calls. |
| **Zustand** | Client state management. Lightweight, minimal boilerplate for UI state not tied to server. |
| **shadcn/ui** | UI components. Accessible (Radix-based), customizable, copy-paste ownership. Favor existing components over custom. |
| **Tailwind CSS** | Styling. Utility-first, consistent design tokens, pairs with shadcn/ui. |
| **Sandpack** | Browser code execution. Renders HTML/React/CSS in iframe sandbox for artifact previews. |

---

## Marketing Site

| **Axiom** | Logs. Serverless-friendly. |

---

## AI / LLM

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **OpenRouter** | LLM gateway. Single API for GPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, others. Model metadata API for auto-discovery. |

---

## Development

| **Vitest** | Unit/integration testing. |
| **Playwright** | E2E testing. Cross-browser,. |
| **fishery** | Test factories with traits, sequences, and async DB creation. |
| **@faker-js/faker** | Realistic fake data generation. |
| **MinIO** | Local S3 mock. Emulates R2 for local development. |
| **Payment Mocks** | Local mock for Helcim. No real API calls in local development. |
| **Helcim Sandbox** | Helcim's test environment. Used in CI for real payment flow testing. |

## Data Flow

### Cloud Mode
```
Browser → API (Workers) → Neon Postgres / R2
                       → OpenRouter (LLM)
                       → Fly.io (code execution)
```

### Local-Only Mode
```
Browser → API (Workers) → OpenRouter (LLM)
   ↓                    → Fly.io (code execution)
PGlite (IndexedDB)
   
Server returns responses but never persists.
Browser stores everything in PGlite.
Does not support S3 usage like media. Text only.
```

---

## API Patterns

| Pattern | Technology | Use Case |
|---------|------------|----------|
| Request/Response | Hono + Zod | CRUD, auth, file uploads |
| SSE Streaming | Hono streaming | LLM token streaming, code execution output |

---

## Local Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Starts:
- Vite (frontend) on :5173
- Wrangler (Workers) on :8787
- Postgres (Docker) on :5432
- MinIO (S3 mock) on :9000

All external APIs (OpenRouter, Helcim) are mocked locally. Real API calls (to OpenRouter and Helcim Sandbox) only run in CI when a LOME team member comments "pr test". These tests must pass to merge the PR.
